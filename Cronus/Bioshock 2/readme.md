# Explanation
This script is to automate the process of turret hacking boosting in Bioshock 2 multiplayer. 
There are two scripts. The faster script is for when you unlock the "Fast hacking" perk within the game.

# How to use
Click in the right stick when you are in front of the turret to start the hacking loop. Clicking in again will disable the script.
