Script created for the Victorious Gold achievement in DKO. To obtain this achievement, you need to get 100 wins. This script will automate 2 player quitouts. You'll need 2 consoles and 2 CM/Titan devices.

Depending on the order in which your boosting partner loads into the friends list, use either v1 or v2. This was not consistent for me across two boosting sessions. 

Ver 1: When inviting a boosting partner to join the lobby, use this version if the boosting partner is in position 1. 
Ver 2: When inviting a boosting partner to join the lobby, use this version if the boosting partner is in position 2.
