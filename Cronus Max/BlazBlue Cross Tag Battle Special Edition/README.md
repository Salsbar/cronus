# Instructions:
Choose Waldstein as the character within the Tactics menu. 
First complete the Character Explanation step. 
For each of the 6 character combo missions, activate the respective script. 
Timing and placement may impact the success of the script. Generally, push the enemy into the right side wall, with your character right next to them. 
If the combo is not successful on the first attempt, allow it to continue cycling. 
For specific character placement, refer to the sudden_fall youtube video: https://youtu.be/6tvW_wE7_ck.
RT activates the combo & B cancels it.
