# Xbox Live Ranked Match Automation Script

## Overview

This script automates the process of playing and winning ranked matches on Xbox Live for Player 1. It is designed to handle menu navigation, character selection, and match completion, ensuring progress is saved for the PAL version. This script is ideal for idling the level 10 character but can also assist with the level 3 achievement.

## Setup Instructions

### Player 1 Setup (Person Getting the Wins)
1. From the main menu, go to `Xbox Live > Ranked Match > Select Character > Custom Match`.
2. Highlight the option to start the match.

### Player 2 Setup (Person Losing/The Dummy)
1. From the main menu, go to `Xbox Live > Ranked Match > Select Character`.
2. Highlight the option for a quick match.

### Starting the Script
1. Press the left stick (LS) on Player 1's controller and the right stick (RS) on Player 2's controller simultaneously to start the script.

## Script Behavior

- The script will start a match, select the default character choices, and then finish the match.
- To ensure the script doesn't get lost in the menus and that progress is saved for the PAL version, the script will back out to the title screen and re-enter the correct setup position.
- This script is primarily meant to idle the level 10 character but can also be used for the level 3 achievement. Note that it will not change characters for you (this feature may be added in a future version).
- Be mindful that not every character combination has been tested. Since each character has different damage and health, it is recommended to keep an eye on the script's progress, although it is designed to work with any character.
