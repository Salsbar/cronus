# Xbox Live Quick Match Automation Script

## Overview

This script requires 2 Titans/Cronus devices to work. It automates the process of playing and winning quick matches on Xbox Live, focusing on leveling up a character to level 10 or achieving the level 3 achievement.

## Setup Instructions

### Initial Setup
1. Make sure both accounts have the same DLC (or make sure neither have DLC). Ignore the message about a missing update.
2. Do one match manually and pick Gipsy Danger for both accounts.
3. Go to Xbox Live and highlight Quick Match on both accounts.
4. Click the Left Stick (LS) on the account getting XP and the Right Stick (RS) on the account losing.

## Script Behavior

- The script will start a match on the winning account and then wait for the dummy account to join.
- The host will mash X until the dummy is dead.
- You must manually change factions when you hit level 30 on the current faction.

## Notes

- Ensure both accounts are properly set up and have the same DLC or none at all.

For any issues or suggestions, please contact the script developer.
