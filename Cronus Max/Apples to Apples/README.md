# Xbox Live Game Achievement Unlock Script

## Overview

This script requires 3 scripting devices to work. It will unlock the following achievements:
- **An Apple A Day**: Reach the Orchard Rank in Xbox LIVE by playing 500 games.
- **Apple-opolis**: Unlock all the Apple Avatars [48 wins in online matches].

## Setup Instructions

### Game Settings
1. With one account, go to: `Play Now > Xbox LIVE Game > Custom Match`.
2. Use the following settings (the ones not listed do not matter):
    - Mode: Custom Match
    - Total Players: 3
    - Game Length: 1 card
    - Time Limit: 5 sec.
3. If you want to avoid random players joining, set private slots to 2.
4. You may turn on Golden Apple Cards to make progress on other achievements while the script runs.
5. Invite two other players and make sure the host is highlighting the "Invite Friends" option.

### Starting the Script
1. On the controller that is hosting, click the Right Stick (RS) to start the script.
2. On the other two controllers, wait for the loading screen to appear and then click RS on those as well.

## Script Behavior

- The script will start a match, let the time play out to end the round and thus the game.
- The script will skip all rewards and return every player to the lobby, wait 30 seconds for safety, then start the next match.
- Extra time is added to ensure that the host player does not invite others randomly.
- Playing 500 matches will take roughly 18 and a half hours.
- The script has been tested for about 8 hours with no hiccups, but it is recommended to keep an eye on it, especially at the beginning.

## Notes
- The script may get out of sync due to the rewards that pop up between matches. Four A presses have been inserted to account for this, but if there are more than 3 or 4 at one time, it may cause a de-sync.
- If a de-sync occurs the accounts may end up in the Xbox 360 guide. Lag or console freeze can also cause this.
- You may also work on achievements for playing golden apple cards while the script is running if you wish.
