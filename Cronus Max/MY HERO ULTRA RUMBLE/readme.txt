MY HERO ULTRA RUMBLE
//AFK matches
//This automates XP, some gold, some agency points, gallery pieces, mission stars and event EP


good characters to run for the script are the frog girl, floaty (the pink suit girl that looks like an astronaut), and cementoss.


This will not complete the game for you, since you still need to play a lot of hours for the gold and agency points. this script is just a way to get some of the game done if you dont care about full completion, or assist in attempting for completion by getting a fairly consistent 500-1000 agency points per night to add up to the one million.
