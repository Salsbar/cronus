# Lego 2K Drive

This script helps automates the grind for the 3K and 6K Drive achievements by drifting in circles in the test drive area and using boost when available

## Usage

First, load up test drive in an appropriate boat

1. Go to any garage
2. Go to collection and select a boat
    1. I used "Justa Plane Boat" (+14/-18/0/+9)
    2. In theory, any boat should be fine but try to pick one with the same stats
3. Select "Test Drive"

Once loaded in, simply make sure the script is loaded and click in LS to start it up.
If you want to stop it at any point, click in RS.
Assuming you have it unlocked in free roam, load up 

## Additional Notes

* Boost timer is based on being an A class racer
* I'm not sure they matter much, but the perks I had equipped were
    * Drift boost
    * *doesn't matter*
    * Handling boost
