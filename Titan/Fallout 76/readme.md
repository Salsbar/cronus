# Fallout 76

A small script to help with getting [Friends in Low Places](https://www.trueachievements.com/viewcomment.aspx?commentid=1361257#sc1361257) for becoming allies with Crater.

<details>
<summary>Here is an excerpt from the solution:</summary>

Steps simplified.
1. Get Retirement Plan Daily Mission/Quest(If given the other mission, complete it and wait until the next day.)
2. Talk to Rocksy about the Raider.
3. Confront the Raider and Attack.
4. Report back/talk to Rocksy.
5. "Appalachia has a new corpse"
6. Quickly back out of the conversation after saying the dialoug.
7. Repeat steps 4-6.
</details>

Specifically, this helps automate the conversation hand-in then back-out loop i.e. steps 4-6 above.

## Usage

Follow the TA solution until you are ready to talk/report to Rocksy.

Find Rocksy and plop yourself in front of them (so that the prompt to talk to them appears).

Click the LS to trigger the script. 
Click LS again at any point to stop.

Keep an eye on it, in case the npc wanders off or other players get in the way.
