# Halo Reach (Halo MCC)

A simple script to help with getting score on Lone Wolf. A main facet of the strategy is to melee the enemies in the back. By default(?) this is done by pressing B. With the amount of meleeing to get this achievement, I made a simple remapper to instead do this with RT.

This was made so long ago that there are likely simpler methods to do this, but I've uploaded it all the same.

## Usage

No action necessary beyond loading up the script.
