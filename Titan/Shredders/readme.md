This script helps automates calling the snowmobile for unlocking "Discount please!" achievement.

## Usage

Assuming you have it unlocked in free roam, load up 

* Area:     Elysium
* Type:     Spawns
* Select:   Peak

As soon as you load up, click the LS to start and leave it alone. You can click LS again at any time to pause the script

I haven't extensively tested it, so maybe keep an eye on it, though it should only take around half an hour.
