# Devil May Cry 5 - General Information

This is an assist script for farming red orbs.

There is an often shared method for farming red orbs using the Hat Trick move during Mission 13 as Dante. Using this move requires perfect timing on pressing B to catch the hat as it returns. This script makes it easy by taking control of those precise timings.

Please look at one of the many guides out there for more context on the strategy itself and what prep you may need to do.

## Usage

Hold B to use the Hat Trick move on repeat.

You will still want to run around and jump to avoid getting hit and losing orbs.

> It looks like I was playing with some other ideas with the setHat and rbHold combos, but seemingly never finished as they are unused - I'll leave them in incase but they could probably be cleaned out.
