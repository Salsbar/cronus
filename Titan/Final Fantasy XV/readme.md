# Final Fantasy XV

A small script to help with getting [Survival Expert](https://www.trueachievements.com/viewcomment.aspx?commentid=1048570#sc1048570) for reaching maximum survival level i.e. Gladio.

Levelling of survival can be done as easily as playing as Gladio and running around. So, here's a script that simply runs in circles (and jumps?). Who needs rubber bands eh?

## Usage

Load up in the open world (preferably a big open space without enemies), switch to Gladio, and start the script by quickly double tapping Y.

^_I'm not 100% sure that's the trigger, but based on the code and a hazy memory, that's my best guess. If someone uses it, please update this readme appropriately._
