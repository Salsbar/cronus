# Injstice 2

There are two main things in here.

1. Scripts from someone in the Cronus forums to farm the towers using a particular character
2. The `LearningChallenges` script to help with a handful of the learning challenges I struggled with

## Tower Farm

I in no way deserve any credit here. I collated some scripts that were shared in a forum (the `Original (CM)` folder), and used the open source CM > T2 converter tool to create those in `Converted (T2)`. For usage directions, please see those files.

## Learning Challenges

The script will run a single combo upon clicking LS. Each combo corresponds to a particular learning challenge stage, and only a small subset are covered (if I couldn't do one fairly quickly myself, I would write a new combo for it as needed).

1. Load into challenge
2. Specify the relevant combo in `combo_run(<combo name>);`
3. Compile and load script onto device
3. Click LS
4. Disable script

If someone determines which they help with more precisely, please list that here.
