This does not help with any achievements _directly_, but does help make the game easier by **automating an exploit allowing you to get items from the shop for free.**

How to buy anything from any shop regardless of Gilt

Go to any store and then go to the Sell tab
Press cn_LB and cn_A with a very very slight delay between each press and it should have you switched over to the Buy tab but with a pop up saying "are you sure you want to sell this item?"
Select Yes and it will buy the item, if you do have Gilt on your character it will use it up, but again you can do this at 0 Gilt and you're able to sell the items back to make profit which you can use to buy abilities from Thane and Draven (You can't use this exploit on them as there is no Sell tab).

The advantages of this exploit are buying the best gear for your level and that you can overstock yourself on health potions! Usually you can only have a max of 5 health potions but I finished the game with 32 left to use.

*Edit* Be cautious when using this glitch with Vulgrim's store!
As mentioned by Vin√≠ciusLCH in the comments, if you do this glitch at Vulgrim's Store and use your Boat Coins currency it will actually drop the currency amount into the negative and won't go back to normal until you collect enough Boat Coins to bring it back to zero. This also carries over to New Game+ also.
