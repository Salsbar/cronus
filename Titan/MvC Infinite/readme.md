# Marvel vs Capcom Infinite

This was actually the first game I ever used and wrote scripts for. Specifically, to help with getting [Master Class](https://www.trueachievements.com/a240723/master-class-achievement#418434) which was for completing all missions for any 5 characters.

## Usage

Due to the sheer age of these scripts take this with a good helping of salt...

There are scripts for a subset of missions for a subset of characters. I wrote these as I needed them so they generally only include the higher tier missions. For one or two partial input sequences, writing them in raw gpc proved difficult so I recorded a snippet into a macro (.gmk) for use in the gpc.

To use, go into the script for the character you want, then change the value inside `combo_run(<value>)` to the appropriate combo name. Load the script up, load the desired mission, press X, and watch.
