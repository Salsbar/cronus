# Party Animals

This is a simple script to farm XP with bots to get XP.

All it does it send A every second. This achieves two things

1. Avoid getting AFK kicked by repeatedly jumping
2. (Re)Trigger map loop 

Note there is a maximum amount of XP you can earn a day from custom games, so keep an eye on it. From personal experience, this happens after around [todo].

## Pre-requisute

Map jumping to A.

By default it is mapped to Y. You can change it by:

1. Go to "Settings"
2. RB twice to "Control"
3. Scroll down to "Actions"
4. Change "Jump / Climb" to A and "Kick / Dropkick" to Y
5. Press Y to apply the change


## Usage

From the main menu, go to Custom Games > Create > Last Stand > Select "All" maps > Press Y to create.

Then, cick the padlock near the top of the screen and Y to apply - this will stop randoms joining.

Now, in match settings:
* Disable Friendly Fire : On
* **Max HP : 1%**
* Max Stamina : 200%
* Stamina Regen Speed : 200%
* **Last Stand Team Number : 2 Teams**

The important ones are max hp and number of teams, but the rest won't hurt.

Add 3 hard bots to your team, and 1 easy bot to the other.

Finally, hit Start and trigger the script with LS.
You can click LS again at any time to pause the script.

The LED will be green when active, and red when stopped.
