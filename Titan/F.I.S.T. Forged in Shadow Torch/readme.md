# F.I.S.T.: Forged in Shadow Torch

A small collection of scripts to help with "Martial Arts Heir" - "Completed all combo training at the training field"

These were originally made for autogh (by D3LTA) and converted for titan.

They are not perfect and could be improved, but they were able to net me the achievement. 
Training is located by talking to Master Wu on the east side of Joffree Street.
