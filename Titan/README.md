# Titan Two

This is a collection of script primarily targeted at the titan two from consoletuners, developed in GTuner IV.

Whilst the file extension is also `.gpc`, it is more accurate to call it GPC2 as it has a number of improvements over the original GPC (which was designed for the CronusMax and Titan One).
